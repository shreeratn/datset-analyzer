## About the Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

Although there are many packages which can be used to anayze the data, this repo keeps in mind the minimalism and low key usages without displaying any overwhelming feature which also keeps the resource usage to minimum

Here's detail which are shown as column-wise:

* Datatype
* Total number of Values
* Total number of Null values
* Total number of Unique values
* Percent of Unique values 
* Determine that given column might be categorical
* Determine that given column might be ignored


A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

<br />

**[![warning-icon](https://img.shields.io/badge/WARNING-red?style=for-the-badge&color=ea004c)]()**

**You cannot change window while the simulator is running, If you do so the upcoming keys combination from your clipboard might be lethal and crash your system in worst case scenario. STOP THE SIMUATION OR LET IT BE COMPLETED**

<br />

## Usage

1. Run the main.py in terminal
2. Estimate time you need before the simulator starts typing which should include:
   * Time required changing the window to the editor you want to use
   *   Placing the cursor at starting position where you want to start the simulator to type in
